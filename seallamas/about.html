                <h2>What is a Sea Llama?</h2>
                <p class="indented">
                    A Sea Llama is an animal that is part Llama, Unicorn, Sea lion, and Sea horse. 
                    They are most commonly found in southern regions near water, but are also found 
                    elsewhere, usually only in very large lakes and oceans. A group of Sea llamas is 
                    called a herd. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p class="indented">
                    Sea Llamas have two main forms: Land Form, and Sea Form, which they switch back 
                    and forth between to fit their environment. A Sea Llama in Sea Form has the head 
                    of a Llama, with slightly more fur than normal, the tail of a Sea Horse, the flippers 
                    of a Sea Lion, and a Unicorn horn. When they are on land, they’re flippers, horn, 
                    and tail disappear, leaving a regular looking llama with webbed feet. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p class="indented">
                    Sea Llamas also have a form of telepathy, which they use to communicate with 
                    other species. They are highly allergic to water bottles, and die eventually  
                    in the presence of one, and the most common symptom is sneezing. This makes  
                    Sea Llamas, among other things, high-quality water bottle detectors. They 
                    generally with each other by making a humming sound that is often described  
                    as the most beautiful noise ever.

                <br>
                <p class="indented"> 
                    Sea Llamas have a very weak telekinetic power allowing them to move small  
                    objects with their mind as long as the object does not possess some other  
                    force that contradicts the objective of the Sea Llama. This is helpful to  
                    Sea Llamas, as they do not have 
                    hands. When Sea llamas inevitably and sadly die, they leave behind a portal 
                    that leads to wherever the Sea Llama spent most of its life. For more specifics on the Sea Llama, see ---.

                <h2>The Sea Llama Story</h2>
                <p class="indented"> 
                    The Sea Llama Story is a novel that contains the events of a war 
                    between the Sea Llamas and Alpacas. It is written by Micah L. M., 
                    a supporter and celebrant of the Sea Llamas for most of his life.  
                    The book primarily follows the characters Flibbertigibbet 
                    and Bob, both of whom will be explained in later articles. It is 
                    set in the possibly fictional continent of Erijyididibole, the  
                    origins of which are very dark and mysterious. The Story of the Sea 
                    Llamas is set to be officially completed sometime in 
                    Summer 2021. For those who would like it, here is an excerpt of the story: 
                </p>

                <p class="indented">
                    Bob was terrified. 
                </p>
                <p class="indented">
                    20 years ago, he had finished building Sea Llama City upon the western coast of Erijyididibole. 
                    When it the entire project had been finished, 
                    he had been amazed he had been able to do it, as he had been very non-well known, and did not have much of anything 
                    at the time other than his four friends, with whom he had discovered the Sea Llamas. 
                </p> 
                <p class="indented">
                    It was that encounter that had led him to build the City of the Sea  
                    Llamas with Flibbertigibbet, who he realized to late had an obsession  
                    with declaring parties every single day whenever he was able to, which,  
                    before the Cities had been built, had been 
                    not very often. Once he did realize that, he also started noticing all  
                    sorts of other things, like the quality of the sand on the East coast where 
                    Flibbertigibbet had built the City of the Sea Llamas. 
                </p>
                <p class="indented">
                    After he had had enough, he had left to begin building Sea Llama City on 
                    his own elsewhere instead, and then later when both projects were finished,  
                    all the trade from both cites combined had turned Greenpoint into a metropolis full of wonders and Sea  
                    Llamas, as well as Earth Llamas, which were also important, just not nearly as much.  
                </p>
                <p class="indented"> 
                    While Greenpoint for the last 25 years had been flooded with people and new  
                    buildings, it had retained its beautiful plains dotted with large, white,  
                    stones, trees, and rivers. 
                </p>
                <p class="indented"> 
                    But now that was going to change. 
                </p> 
                <p class="indented">
                    The Alpacas, ruled by King Throb, who lived in in the north across the Enar-Mos 
                    Mountains on a huge plateau they had so creatively named “The Plateau of the  
                    Alpacas,” had declared war on the Llamas exactly one week ago, and had warned them to expect a 
                    surprise attack (“expect a surprise attack?”) seven days from then. 
                </p>
                <p class="indented">
                    Bob had been brooding over that while watching Sea Llama City prepare  
                    for war for a while, now. They had been up through the night planning and  
                    setting up fortifications. He was now considering taking the time to send 
                    a message to Flibbertigibbet, warning  
                    him, but he expected he would already know, and had probably also received a message from the Alpacas as well. 
                </p>
                <p class="indented">
                    Currently Bob was standing atop his deck, gazing over the restless city.  
                    The sun was shining, and there were few clouds out, but overall, the day felt oddly dreary. 
                </p>
                <p class="indented">
                    Bob looked up toward the blue sky as a raven flew over him,  
                    casting a dark shadow and circling his tall, brick house once, cawing once before soaring away again. 
                </p>
                <p class="indented">
                    'Tis totally not an omen,' he thought. 'Only Sea Llamas bring omens.' 
                </p>
                <p class="indented">
                    However, his thoughts were then interrupted. His senior advisor and messenger, 
                    Fred, walked through the clay brick doorway behind him, and moved forward to stand next to him. 
                </p>
                <p class="indented">
                    “They have arrived,” said Fred, turning his head to look left at the main gate. 
                </p>
                <p class="indented">
                    “The Alpacas?” Bob responded nervously. “Already?” 
                </p>
                <p class="indented">
                    “No,” Fred answered, eliciting a sigh of relief from Bob.  
                    “A convoy from Flibbertigibbet. They say that the Alpacas have  
                    been seen marching across Enani Savanna.” 
                </p>
                <p class="indented">
                    “How long do we have?” Asked Bob, straightening his back. 
                    “We are not nearly ready enough!” 
                </p>
                <p class="indented">
                    “The messengers said that judging from the Alpaca’s current pace, 
                    we either have another week until they arrive, or it is a decoy and  
                    they are planning a clever ambush,” Fred replied dryly. 
                </p> 
                <p class="indented">
                    This was in fact true, for Alpacas were rather lazy and did not  
                    move very quickly, apart from when they attacked things. 
                </p>
                <p class="indented">
                    “Why hasn’t King Joe done anything about it?” Asked Bob, his eyes moving 
                    for a second to the north. King Joe was the supposed king of all   
                    Erijyididibole, but no one ever really saw him because he very rarely 
                    left the walls of his stronghold, Nauseous 
                    Castle. 
                </p>
                <p class="indented">
                    “Flibbertigibbet thinks it is because there is a good chance that  
                    he hasn’t really noticed yet,” Fred answered cautiously. 
                </p>
                <p class="indented">
                    “Have King Throb or General Bat been spotted?” Bob asked.  
                    General Bat had a reputation as a terrifying reputation as someone who fought like a 
                    Lion, (strange, considering he was literally named Bat.) 
                    and had been the primary leader of the Alpaca’s armies 
                    for as long as anyone could remember. 
                </p> 
                <p class="indented">
                    “No, which is unusual for Bat,” Answered Fred. “Normally he always leads the frontal assaults.” 
                </p>
                <p class="indented">
                    There was yet another long silence as Bob and Fred thought. 
                    Bob squinted at Fred, and then outward toward the coastal plains in front of Greenpoint. 
                </p>
                <p class="indented">
                    “Well, in that case, please inform the Sea Llamas of this 
                    and we will see what Lord Ethwir thinks.” Bob eventually answered. 
                    “He is very wise. Also recall the team of guards scouting the perimeter, 
                    and then close the gates. I have a feeling if we do not 
                    do it now it will be too late later.” 
                </p>
                <p class="indented">
                    “I will.” 
                </p>
                <p class="indented">
                    Fred left the balcony, leaving Bob to think.

                <p class="indented">
                    There is a collection of songs about the Sea Llamas, written by Micah L.M.There are many, all of which outline the 
                    greatness of the Sea Llamas.The most well known one is about the discovery of the Sea Llamas.Here are the lyrics: 
                </p>
                <div class="lyrics">
                    <br>
                    V1:
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    There was once a funny creature that was swimming in the sea<br>
                    It had the head of a large llama and was fluffy as could be<br>
                    Instead of feet it had a tail that belonged to a sea horse<br>
                    And it had flippers from a sea lion that were extremely coarse
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    V2:
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    And then came along five people that did not know what to think<br>
                    They were so surprised with what they saw that they could barely blink<br>
                    Then they argued about what it was till they decided this:<br>
                    They'd discovered a new animal though something was amiss
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    V3:
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    But what to call it? None could say. So they thought about it more<br>
                    Then they argued till their throats became so very very sore<br>
                    They here acknowledged the llama head, and so they loudly brawled<br>
                    But it was a llama in the sea, Sea Llama it was called
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Chorus:
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Great O sea Llama,<br>
                    O Sea Llama,<br>
                    Thou art amazing<br>
                    Singest all who seeth a great O Sea Llama thing<br>
                    For<br>
                    Sea Llamas they are great<br>
                    And they're very very strong<br>
                    And they're so extremely smart,<br>
                    That they're never ever wrong
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    V4:

                    <br>
                    So the people called Sea Llama and the sea llama then came<br>
                    But when it stepped onto the sand it looked like it was not the same<br>
                    For it lost it's flippers and it's tail, it had instead some legs,<br>
                    And it left the people thinking it could very well lay eggs
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    (Chorus)
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    V5
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Twas here the people noticed that it's ears were rather thick<br>
                    Twas about here that they noticed that Sea Llamas were magic<br>
                    But they never really noticed that it's ears were actually horns,<br>
                    The kind that you would normally find on top of unicorns
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    (Chorus)
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Bridge:
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The sea llama then squawked<br>
                    And it really loudly sung<br>
                    And so the people watched<br>
                    They're jaws were deeply hung<br>
                    But then the llama stopped<br>
                    And then it sadly sneezed<br>
                    And all the people's spirits dropped<br>
                    Whilst a persons thirst was eased

                    This was because sea llamas have some big bad allergies<br>
                    It causes them to do some things much worse than loudly sneeze<br>
                    Sea llamas are allergic to all kinds of water bottle<br>
                    And it is the only thing a sea llama would throttle

                    The Sea Llama then really sadly fell onto the sand<br>
                    And so the people thought that they should surely lend a hand<br>
                    They thought till they decided all they're food would be to give,<br>
                    They gave it to the sea llama so that the sea llama could live!

                <h2>The Discovery of the Sea Llama</h2>
                <p class="indented">
                    The Sea Llama was discovered on a currently unknown date. On the day that this great and influentual  
                    event occurred, the sun was said to be shining brightly; wind roaring across the world. In other words, 
                    a very beautiful day. On a currently unknown beach, 
                    Flibbertigibbet, Bob, and 3 other humans were sitting on a log eating lunch, they caught a glimpse  
                    of a strange animal off the shore.

                <br>
                <p class="indented">
                    Eventually, after watching said animal for a while, it swam unto the land and stepped onto  
                    the sand, walking over to the humans. It there greeted them in typical Sea Llama fashion, 
                    singing with it's beautiful voice. However, one of the humans was carrying 
                    a water bottle, and this caused the Sea Llama to fall down and begin sneezing excessively. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p class="indented">
                    The humans solved this problem by throwing the water bottle as far as they could inland and  
                    then feeding the Sea Llama all of their food. The Sea Llama and the humans went forth back 
                    to their lives bringing news of the encounter, and thus the two species 
                    began interacting and eventually formed a whole civilization, probably the first to ever 
                    be comprised of more than one type of being.

                <p class="indented">
                    There is also a myth that states that the Sea Llama was a being 'created' by Micah L. M. 
                    However, this possibility has been dismissed by the historians of the era.
